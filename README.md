CODSOFT — Internship Project Suite

A collection of console-based C++ projects completed during my CODSOFT internship, showcasing basic game logic, interactive programming, and input handling.

Projects Overview
Task 1: Number Guessing Game

A fun game where the computer picks a random number and the user guesses until they get it right. The program indicates if the guess is too high or too low.

Features:

Random number generation

User prompt loop until correct answer

Feedback on whether the guess is higher or lower than the secret number

Task 2: Simple Calculator

An interactive calculator that handles basic arithmetic operations.

Features:

Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Validates division by zero

Clean and readable user interface

Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe (Row/Column Input)

A minimalist tic-tac-toe where players pick row and column numbers to place their mark.

Features:

Empty board at the start

Row/column based user input (1–3)

Win and draw detection, alternating turns

Task 4: To-Do List

A simple task manager program that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.

Features:

Add tasks dynamically

Display all tasks in a list

Remove tasks by index

Basic file handling (optional) for saving and retrieving tasks

Task 5: Library Management System

A basic library system that keeps track of books and allows user interactions.

Features:

Add new books with details (title, author, ID)

Display list of available books

Borrow and return functionality

Simple record management through arrays/structures

Technologies Used

Language: C++

Compiler: g++ or equivalent standard C++ compiler
